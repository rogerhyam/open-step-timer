## Modes

The timer has three modes. When you turn it on it will be in Seconds Mode. You can cycle through the modes by pressing the knob down. When a mode is selected its name will be briefly displayed before it switches to displaying the current value.

### Seconds Mode: `SECS`

This works like a “dumb” timer. Simply dial in the number of seconds from 1 to 99.9 with the knob and hit the expose button. Seconds are displayed as 55-4 with the - as the decimal place. The time set in this mode is the base time used by all the other modes.

### F-Steps Mode: F-St

Turning the knob in this mode displays values above or below the base time in steps that are fractions of f-stops. As the knob is turned the variation from the base time is shown in steps e.g. -2. When you stop turning the knob the actual exposure time for that step in seconds is displayed e.g. 22-6.

The size of the step is set in the Interval Mode. 

You can use the F-Steps Mode to make an exposure at an F-Stop distance above or below the base time. For example, making a print two thirds of a stop lighter or darker.

If you press and hold the knob in F-Steps Mode then the displayed time will become the new base time and the timer will switch to Seconds Mode.

### Burn Mode: burn

In Burn Mode you can select the time needed to add a number of steps above the base time to a portion of the print. If the sky needs one stop more dial that in and the required time will be displayed.

### Test Mode: teSt
This mode allows you to make a test print with a series of strips each of which is exposed at a different f-step above and below the base time. In this mode the display is split into two parts by the colon e.g. t7:C2

The two digits on the left of the colon display the number of strips in the test. This will be 3,5,7 or 9. The base exposure will always be the middle strip and it will have either 1,2,3 or 4 strips on either side of it depending on the size of the test selected.

When you first enter Test Mode t7:C0  will be displayed. So long as you haven’t started a test and C0 is displayed you can use the knob to select the size of the test. Once you start exposing strips you can no longer change the size of the test and turning the knob will have no effect.

The two digits on the right of the colon are an instruction. They are the number of strips that you should cover up for the next exposure. They start with C0, then C1 (cover the first strip) C2 (cover the first two strips), C3 (cover the first three strips) etc. up to t - 1. You never cover up the last strip. When the test is complete the display returns to C0 and you can go ahead and develop your test print.

If you want to cancel a test part way through just press the knob to move to next mode.

Once you have made your test print you should switch to F-Steps Mode and select the step that matches the best exposed strip on the print. Remember that the strip in the middle is 0, the darker strips are 1,2,3 steps and the lighter strips are -1,-2,-3 steps. Once you have selected the step and the time is displayed hold down the knob to set that as the new base time for the print. You can go ahead and make a straight print at this time or you can introduce some dodging and burning using the F-Steps Mode and Burn Mode to over and under expose areas of your print relative to the base time.

### Interval Mode: Int-
Use this mode to set the interval between steps - the step size. You can set 1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:5 etc.

These are fractions of an F-Stop.

When you change this your exposure in the F-Steps mode will change.  

Long press the knob in Interval Mode and you get a submode, Fade, (FAdE) which allows you to set the brightness of the display.  

The timer will remember your step size and fade adjustment when it is switched off.

## FAQ

### How do I dodge?
Dodging is just burning a large area! If you want to give the an area of the print ½ a stop less than the rest then use the F-Steps Mode to underexpose the whole print by that amount then, whilst dodging over the area you want to keep light, use the Burn Mode to add ½ a stop to the rest of the print. 

### How do I do split grade printing?
